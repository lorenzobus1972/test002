# test002

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is my first project, i'm trying to learn DART/FLUTTER and at the same time
to create an usefull app for the company Giuditta Srl.

The Idea is to make an app with the following things:
. possibility to log-in (maybe with google account);

different log-in : customers and employees:

  .CUSTOMER -> ONLY PHOTOS AND SOME DETAILS ;
  .EMPLOYEES -> THE FOLLOWING:

when loged-in (AS EMPLOYEES:
. access to all the database of products/items we produce;
. access to details for every produce/items (dimensions, radius, photos, raw-material );
. acces the "Plan of Orders" up-to-date and have the possibility to modify the status on an order:
      .working    .processing   .sanding     .ready
      
.no way to delete orders, no matter the status;
.possibility to know if it's working on service or on sales , to let introduce pieces refused during working process;


A POSSIBILITY:

  LET ACCESS THE CUSTOMERS TO THE STATUS OF THEIR ORDERS - MAKE IT SIMPLE: 
  IN PRODUCTION - READY;
